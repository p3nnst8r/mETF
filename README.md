## What is mETF?

![Example](./img/chart.jpg)

mETF utilizes a bullish stop limit strategy. What that means is that at a certain part around the beginning of the day, the stock will analyze the current price of a particular stock. Once the stock shows a percentage increase it will place an order. The stock will then transition into a stop limit sell strategy, where the price needs to either (whichever is greater):

* needs to fall down a certain percentage, or
* needs to fall back to around the original buy price

After a sell occurs, the tracker will reset and perform the same on the next bullish movement if it satisfies requirements.
